Scenario 1

Context: Kelley, a college student, is searching for volunteer opportunities. Kelley is a biology student, loves volunteering, and is considering becoming a veterinarian. For these reasons, she is interested in volunteering at an animal shelter during her free time.

Kelley is new to Los Angeles and is unfamiliar with volunteer organizations in the area. She wants to find volunteer opportunities near her and compare their locations, requirements, whether they are accepting volunteers, and reviews.

A friend tells Kelley about the Los Angeles Lover of Animals (LALA) app. Kellely downloads the LALA app where she can browse volunteer opportunities based on her current location, see what the time commitments are, and read reviews from previous volunteers. This gives Kelley all of the information she needs to make an informed decision.
