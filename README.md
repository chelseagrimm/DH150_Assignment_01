## DH150 UX Design, Chelsea Grimm

## Introduction: a brief information about the project.

This UX project is designed around creating an online community for animal lovers to connect and come together. I believe humans can connect through animals and that there are so many opportunities and ways this can manifest, but has not been created. Through initial research, I found an abundance of information regarding animal shelters in Los Angeles; however, I found a need for a central location for all of this information and a place for animal lovers to connect. This led to the development of a new app that would provide a hub for animal lovers to do many things in a simple, streamlined fashion. 

## Design statement 

Through exploring different platforms that provide opportunities for animal lovers to come together, I found it a confusing space online. There is so much information from separate entities, with no collaboration. Therefore, I wanted to solve this by creating a centralized location that offered all of these services in one place with the option to learn more about each platform before connecting to it. This is important because it gives users information based on certain criteria they are looking for instead of always going for the top hit on Google. It also creates a collective space where people can share their experiences and unite as a community (ex: both reviews and forum)

## Competitor analysis

The first step in the process was to evaluate some of the current platforms out there for animal lovers to unite through volunteering or shared causes. The two websites I evaluated were the Los Angeles Animal Services website and PETA's website. Overall, these websites provide an abundance of information. However, they are somewhat convaluted and confusing for a user. To read more about the specifics click [here!](https://github.com/chelseagrimm/DH_150/blob/master/Assignment_01/README.md)

Next, I created a usability test based on the features I found to be most confusing: the lack of consistency, calendar page, and search features. The usability test provided deep insights into how a user views the Los Angeles Animal Services website.

## User research 

While the insights I gained from the usability test were helpful, additional research was needed. Therefore, I performed a contextual inquiry to broaden my view and learn more about how users operate. I was inspired by what my user said to make sure that the app I created had real-time updates and a strong sense of community.

## UX storytelling

The next step in the process was to determine who the potential users of my solution would be. This was an important step to understand how to meet specific users' needs and determine what is most important to them. I created three personas who represent the three main tasks I wanted to accomplish: finding a volunteer opportunity, posting on the forum, and searching for a lost pet.
