For as long as I can remember I have been an animal lover. I remember visiting the local animal shelter as a child and being mesmerized by the puppies and kittens behind glass doors, wanting to pet them all and take them all home. I remember taking my first puppy to training with my mom at our local shelter each week to teach her basic commands and help her adjust to life at home. The connection I feel towards animals also connects me to humans. I feel a community around those who love animals and want to help them as much as I do. The county of Los Angeles is so large that the animal shelters are overcrowded and their website is lacking. I believe that the user experience for animal lovers like myself could be improved on the LA Animal Services website to enable users to navigate the services offered with more ease and help more animals. 

The homepage of the LA Animal Services website has nine drop-down menus to take the user to other pages, as well as quick links to take users to popular pages. The website also contains a sidebar with more links to take users through the website. Some of these pages are purely informational, while others are interactive. There are multiple interface designs on different pages of the website. 

While the current LA Animal Services website is full of helpful information, it is not organized in a clear, concise way.
