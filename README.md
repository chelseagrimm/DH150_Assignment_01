For as long as I can remember I have been an animal lover. I remember visiting the local animal shelter as a child and being mesmerized by the puppies and kittens behind glass doors, wanting to pet them all and take them all home. I remember taking my first puppy to training with my mom at our local shelter each week to teach her basic commands and help her adjust to life at home. The connection I feel towards animals also connects me to humans. I feel a community around those who love animals and want to help them as much as I do. The county of Los Angeles is so large that the animal shelters are overcrowded and their website is lacking. I believe that the user experience for animal lovers like myself could be improved on the LA Animal Services website to enable users to navigate the services offered with more ease and help more animals. 

The homepage of the LA Animal Services website has nine drop-down menus to take the user to other pages, as well as quick links to take users to popular pages, both on the LAAS website or other sites like Amazon. The website also contains a sidebar with more links to take users through the website. Some of these pages are purely informational, while others are interactive. There are multiple interface designs on different pages of the website. 

While the current LA Animal Services website is full of helpful information, it is not organized in a clear, concise way. 

# Heuristics Evaluation

## 1. Visibility of the system.

The LA Animal Services website has a good example of visibility of the system on its homepage. There is a banner with the locations listed and the number of fosters currently needed with links to pages to become a foster.

However, 

## 2. Match between the system and the real world.

The LAAS website has links to their social media on the website and use the icons for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

However, 

## 3. User control and freedom.

The link to the foster application takes you to a PDF in which users cannot type into the form.

## 4. Consistency and standards.

On the calendar page, there are multiple calendars with different formats.

On every page there is the toolbar at the top, as well as a sidebar. Many of these links are redundant. For example, clicking the header "Adopt" on the top toolbar menu brings you to the same page as clicking "Adopt a pet today" under the "Looking for a friend" section on the side toolbar menu. 

## 5. Error prevention.

Evaluation:

## 6. Recognition rather than recall.

If users have lost an animal, there is the option to search by animal ID. However, users may not have access to their animal ID number which would inhibit them from using this feature. The website then gives the option to view "Dogs/cats found by the public". This redirects the user to a page of over 50 animals to look through which minimal descriptions, many of which do not have a photo attached. There is another option to search for animals by shelter. However, lost animals may travel far distances and users still have to then sort through pages of animals. This system first expects users to recall a long code, which is not ideal, and if recall is not available, the other option is to do a lot of manual searching through different channels. This process should be streamlined by combining these search tactics into one process and using recognition techniques. (Severity level )

## 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use.

Evaluation:

## 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design.

The design of the LAAS website is not minimalistic and is overwhelming.

## 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.

To test the animal search feature, I inputted a false animal ID. I was then given an error message stating: "Remember, the fewer things you search on, the more animals you will see. Use the 'No Preference' option for breed, gender, age, size and color to see the most animals." at the top of the page as well as: "We are very sorry, but due to high usage we were unable to process your request. Please wait a few moments and try again." in the middle of the page. To the user it is unclear what caused the error and what can be done to fix it. (Severity level )

## 10. Help and documentation.

The search bar on the homepage is small in size, but centered and towards the top of the page. Once you navigate off the homepage the search bar is now on the sidebar, which is not too difficult to spot, but is not intuitive since it has moved locations. Additionally, searching for a simple key word like "adopt" generates results of blog posts instead of how to navigate the website to the adoption pages. The FAQs provide more relevant information to an "adopt" search; however they are located under the "About Us" menu on the top toolbar and not under the "Need Help" menu on the side toolbar.
