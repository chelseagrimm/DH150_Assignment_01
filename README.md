## DH150 UX Design, Chelsea Grimm

## Introduction

This UX project is designed around creating an online community for animal lovers to connect and come together. I believe humans can connect through animals and that there are so many opportunities and ways this can manifest, but a space for this has not been created. Through initial research, I found an abundance of information regarding animal shelters in Los Angeles; however, I found a need for a central location for all of this information and a place for animal lovers to interact and connect. This led to the ideation of a new app that would provide a hub for animal lovers to find volunteer opportunities, communicate, and come together in a simple, streamlined fashion. 

## Design statement 

Through exploring different platforms that provide opportunities for animal lovers, I found it to be a confusing space online. There is so much information from separate entities, with no collaboration. Therefore, I wanted to solve this by creating a centralized location that offers multiple services in one place with the option to learn more about these platforms before connecting to them. This is important because it gives users information based on specific criteria instead of always going for the top hit on Google. It also creates a collective space where people can share their experiences and unite as a community; this feature would be present in all aspects of the app: writing reviews for volunteer experiences, posting/commenting on a forum, and assisting their community finding lost pets.

## Competitor analysis

The first step in the process was to evaluate some of the current platforms out there for animal lovers. The two websites I evaluated were the Los Angeles Animal Services website and PETA's website. Overall, these websites provide an abundance of information. However, they are somewhat convaluted, lacked consistency, and are confusing for a user.

Next, I created a usability test based on the features I found to be most confusing: the lack of consistency, calendar page, and search features. The usability test provided deep insights into how a user views the Los Angeles Animal Services website.

## User research 

While the insights I gained from the usability test were helpful, additional research was needed. Therefore, I performed a contextual inquiry to broaden my view and learn more about how users operate. I was inspired by what my user said to make sure that the app I created had real-time updates, specific details on volunteering needs, and the ability to compare opportunities.

## UX storytelling

The next step in the process was to determine who the potential users of my solution would be. This was an important step to understand how to meet specific users' needs and determine what is most important to them. I created three personas who represent the three main tasks I wanted to accomplish: finding a volunteer opportunity, posting on the forum, and searching for a lost pet.

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation

Based off all of the research I had done, I developed the concept for the Los Angeles Lovers of Animals (LALA) app. I knew I wanted to highlight the three features I found to be most important (finding a volunteer opportunity, posting on the forum, and searching for a lost pet) and there for I had to create screen designs for these pages. Additionally, I wanted to avoid the confusing, over-crowded look of most of the websites already in existence online so I went for minimalistic, easy to follow design.
