# Contextual Inquiry

## Challenge Description

The design challenge is to understand how animal lovers find volunteer opportunities. Volunteering satifies the human need of self esteem; helping others makes you feel good about yourself. I am curious to understand the ways in which animal lovers seek out volunteer opportunities because in my research there is not a collaboritve way to look at and compare opportunities. 

The target user to interview for this task is an animal lover who is interested in volunteering with animals. I am surrounded by a community of animal lovers and I know that my roommate and friend, Elana Rapaich, has been hoping to volunteer at an animal shelter since she has more free time this quarter. This makes her the perfect candidate for my research.

To discover how she goes about this process, I will interview her and ask her questions about how she would approach searching for volunteer opportunities. I have prepared a script with background questions to understand her experience and motives and ask her to explain to me how she would go about performing certain tasks.

## Reflection/Conclusions

To complete this assignment, I had to write a script, find an ideal participant, interview the participant, transcribe the interview, and interpret the findings. I would say that everything went smoothly, for the most part. If I could change anything I would have prepared more questions to ask the participant, based on her responses. I wouldn't have to ask every single question but it would have been helpful to have options based on where the discussion went.

From this process I gained great insights into making volunteering more accessible for users. My personal opinions were confirmed by a real-life user that it would be helpful to have an application in which volunteer opportunities are listed with their pertinent information to be able to compare and contrast different opportunities. Additionally I gained new ideas from the user's past experience and watching her complete the tasks. For example, it would be helpful to keep users up to date with current needs for volunteers. Overall, it was extremely helpful to conduct a contextual inquiry interview because it gave me a perspective that I did not have before.
