# Contextual Inquiry

## Challenge Description

The design challenge is to understand how animal lovers find volunteer opportunities. Volunteering satifies the human need of self esteem; helping others makes you feel good about yourself. I am curious to understand the ways in which animal lovers seek out volunteer opportunities because in my research there is not a collaboritve way to look at and compare opportunities. 

The target user to interview for this task is an animal lover who is interested in volunteering with animals. I am surrounded by a community of animal lovers and I know that my roommate and friend, (insert name), has been hoping to volunteer at a dog shelter since she has more free time this quarter. This makes her the perfect candidate for my research.

To discover how she goes about this process, I will interview her and ask her questions about how she would approach searching for volunteer opportunities. I have prepared a script with background questions to understand her background and motives and ask her to explain to me how she would go about performing certain tasks.
