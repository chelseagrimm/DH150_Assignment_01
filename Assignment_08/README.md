# High Fidelity Prototype

## Description

The Los Angeles Lovers of Animals app (LALA) is intended as a hub for animal lovers looking to get involved within this community. This prototyping phase was done to map out three of the key functions: finding volunteer opportunities, searching for a lost pet, and posting to the forum. It was based off three personas and a low-fidelity prototype previously created. The high fidelity prototype allowed me to see what LALA could look like in an app realistically and see how users would actually use it.

## Decision making

I wanted to make the graphical interface simple and intuitive because there is a lot of information and there are many paths a user can take on the app. This is something I wanted to change from the original website I studied and I think that I achieved a simple, easy to use design. For the color scheme, I wanted to incorporate yellow because it is friendly and inviting to me. I know that purple and yellow are complementary colors and look nice together. I then used contrast-ratio.com to determine shades that would be accesible. For the buttons, the contrast ratio is 5.46 and for text on the backgorund the ratio is 6.39.
