# DH150 Usability Testing

## Intro

The Los Angeles Animal Services website serves as the hub for all animal services in Los Angeles. There is a wealth of information, opportunities to volunteer/donate, search for adoptable and lost pets, and even more on the site. 

I wanted to test the ease of navigation throughout the website. There are multiple toolbars and menus on different pages, lacking consistency. I also specifically wanted to test the calendar and search functions because in the heuristic evaluation they stood out as confusing features. Therefore, I designed the tasks around using these features.

As defined on usability.gov, “a usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a user’s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the website.” The purpose of the usability test is to see how a user would navigate the website candidly and find areas to improve the website.

I set up a portable, minimalistic lab in my apartment. I had my laptop set up at the dining room table so that it would be connected to a power source and I could easily sit next to my participant. I used ActivePresenter 7 to screen and video record the session. This usability test is a pilot test, meaning that it is not only testing the website, but also testing the UT materials.

The pilot usability test I created consisted of background questions, pre-test questions, tasks, and post-test questions. The background questions were used to determine whether or not the participant had used the website before, and if so the details of how and why they used it. The pre-test questions were used to determine how easy the website looked to use before actually using it. The tasks were used to specifically test the features I found most confusing in the heuristic evaluation. The post-test questions were used to understand the participant’s thoughts and feelings after completing the tasks. This process was designed to measure the ease of use of the volunteer, calendar, and search functions of the Los Angeles Animal Services website.

## Conclusions

Overall, I believe my pilot test was successful. It was fascinating to see the Los Angeles Animal Services website through someone else’s eyes who had never seen it before after critiquing it for hours in the heuristic evaluation. There were some issues that I identified in the heuristic evaluation that my participant did not seem to notice, which made me question if they are truly issues. For example, I found the calendar page to be confusing because there were three separate calendars, but my participant never scrolled past the first calendar. My participant did an incredible job thinking aloud and explaining her process. I think I did a fine job at creating the tasks and scenarios; however, I think I made some of the steps too simple. In this user test, I based the tasks off the most severe problems I discovered in my heuristic evaluation. In the future, I would create a UT test with tasks that are all related to each other so that it more closely mimics how a user would use the website fluidly.
